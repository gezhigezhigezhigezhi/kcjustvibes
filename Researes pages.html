        <p>We are a non-profit website dedicated to helping and providing aids to at-risk women in Austin, Texas. 
		In our city alone, we have over 2,000 people experiencing homelessness with at least 40% of these people being women. 
		Around the country,there is a rise in homelessness due to fast population growths in major cities, which in turn 
		contributes to rising housing costs. Almost every group of people are affected by homelessness including veterans, 
		survivors of domestic violence, young children, runaway youth, refugees, and immigrant families. Our aim is to provide 
		resources to empower women with information from our database to help them meet their needs in various areas.</p>

      <h2>Mential Illness/Addiction</h2>
      <p>According to the Mayo Clinic, a mental illness is defined to be 
	  any disorder that causes a change in a person’s behavior or mood, 
	  and disrupts a person’s ability to function [2]. Mental illness 
	  is thought to affect 25% of the homeless population in America, 
	  even being the third largest cause for homelessness. It can hinder 
	  a person’s ability to create and maintain stable relationships, 
	  jobs, and affect an individual's ability to perform daily care 
	  activities [3]. The National Bureau of Economic Research reports 
	  that there is a high correlation between individuals suffering 
	  from a mental illness and self-medication. Among individuals 
	  suffering from a diagnosed mental illness, about 69% suffer 
	  from alcoholism, 84% suffer from cocaine addiction, and 68% 
	  suffer from nicotine addiction [4].

      <p>Unemployment is defined as individuals who are currently unemployed but are 
	  actively seeking employment. Underemployment is defined as individuals who are 
	  highly skilled but are not working at their full capacity [6]. Although 
	  unemployment rates are declining, homelessness rates continue to increase due 
	  to the aftermath of the Great Recession as well as wages not keeping up with 
	  the rising costs of living [7]. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, 
	  the current unemployment rate in Austin is 2.6%.</p>

      <h2>Healthcare and Family Planning</h2>
      <p>In general, 73% of homeless women are unable to meet medical, dental, 
	  mental, prenatal, and other preventative care. They face higher rates of 
	  chronic illnesses including asthma, mental diseases, anemia, bronchitis, 
	  and hypertension among other problems. Furthermore, homeless women have 
	  higher pregnancy and unintended pregnancy rates than the rest of the population. 
	  Homeless women are more often provided with user-based failure rates rather than 
	  long-acting reversible contraceptives. They are more likely to have preterm 
	  deliveries than other women [8].</p>
